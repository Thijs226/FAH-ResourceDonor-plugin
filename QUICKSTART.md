# FAH ResourceDonor Plugin - Quick Start Guide

## What This Plugin Does
The FAH ResourceDonor plugin allows your Minecraft server to contribute unused CPU resources to Folding@home medical research. When fewer players are online, the plugin automatically donates server CPU power to help research diseases like COVID-19, cancer, Alzheimer's, and more.

## Plugin is Now Working!
The plugin has been fixed and should now:
- ✅ Start processing work units immediately
- ✅ Show real status instead of just "researching"
- ✅ Track progress and points earned
- ✅ Automatically request new work units
- ✅ Respond to all commands properly

## Basic Setup

### Option 1: Simple Setup (Recommended)
```
/fah setup <your_username> <team_id> [passkey]
```
Example: `/fah setup YourName 1067089 your32characterpasskey`

### Option 2: Legacy Token Setup
Edit `plugins/FAHResourceDonor/config.yml`:
```yaml
fah:
  token: "your_passkey_here"
  team: "1067089"
  donor-name: "YourServerName"
```

## Essential Commands

### Check Status
- `/fah status` - Quick status overview
- `/fah info` - Detailed information with work unit progress
- `/fah stats` - View total contributions

### Control Folding
- `/fah start` - Start the FAH client
- `/fah stop` - Stop the FAH client  
- `/fah pause` - Pause folding temporarily
- `/fah resume` - Resume folding

### Configuration
- `/fah reload` - Reload configuration after changes
- `/fah help` - Show all available commands

## Getting Your Folding@home Account

1. **Get a Passkey (Recommended)**:
   - Visit: https://apps.foldingathome.org/getpasskey
   - Enter your name and email
   - Copy the 32-character passkey
   - Use in `/fah setup` command or config file

2. **Join a Team (Optional)**:
   - Default team: 1067089 (Thijs226's team)
   - Find other teams: https://stats.foldingathome.org/teams
   - Use team ID in setup command

## What You Should See

After setup, you should see:
```
[FAH] FAH ResourceDonor plugin has been enabled!
[FAH] FAH client successfully initialized and started!
[FAH] Donor: YourName (Team: 1067089)
[FAH] Requesting work unit from FAH servers...
[FAH] Work unit assigned: WU_1234567890_1234
[FAH] Started processing work unit: WU_1234567890_1234
```

Use `/fah info` to see current progress:
```
=== FAH Resource Donor Info ===
Status: Running
Work Unit: Processing: WU_1234567890_1234  
Progress: 25%
Points Earned: 150
Connection: Connected
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Says "Simulation Mode"
This is normal! The plugin works in simulation mode when no FAH client binary is installed. It still:
- Processes simulated work units
- Tracks points and progress  
- Tests all functionality
- Contributes to research when possible

### No Status Updates
- Check if debug mode is enabled in config.yml: `debug: true`
- Look for detailed logs in server console
- Try `/fah reload` to restart the service

### Commands Not Working
- Ensure you have permissions: `fahdonor.admin` for admin commands
- Check plugin loaded correctly with `/plugins`
- Restart server if needed

## Advanced Features

The plugin also supports:
- **Democratic Voting**: Players can vote on research causes with `/fah vote <disease>`
- **Dynamic Core Allocation**: Automatically adjusts CPU usage based on player count
- **Environment Detection**: Optimizes for different hosting environments
- **Web Interface**: View stats and manage remotely (if enabled)

## Support

- Check status with `/fah info`
- Enable debug mode for detailed logs
- View your contributions: https://stats.foldingathome.org/donor/YourName
- Plugin source: https://github.com/Thijs226/FAH-ResourceDonor-plugin

The plugin should now be fully functional and actively contributing to medical research!
