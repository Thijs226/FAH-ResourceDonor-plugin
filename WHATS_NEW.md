# 🎊 Plugin Enhancements Complete - What's New!

Hey! I've finished enhancing your FAH ResourceDonor plugin. Here's what I added:

## 🌟 Major New Features

### 1. Interactive GUI Menus
**Command:** `/fah gui`

Instead of spamming chat, players can now open a beautiful menu showing:
- Server statistics (total points, work units, core hours)
- Personal contributions (your time, points, work units)
- Current FAH status (running, processing, progress)

**Why it's cool:** Modern Minecraft plugins use GUIs, not chat spam!

### 2. Customizable Notifications
**Command:** `/fah notifications <type> <on|off>`

Players can now control what notifications they see:
- **Boss Bars**: Progress bars at top of screen
- **Action Bars**: Text above hotbar
- **Titles**: Big celebration messages
- **Chat**: Traditional chat messages

**Why it's cool:** Everyone has different preferences - now they can choose!

### 3. Persistent Statistics Database
Everything is now saved to a database:
- All player contributions (even after restart)
- Complete work unit history
- Server performance over time
- Reward distribution records

**Why it's cool:** You'll never lose statistics again, and you can analyze trends!

### 4. Professional Logging System
All plugin activity is logged to organized files:
- Daily log files (`fah-2025-10-29.log`)
- Categorized by component (FAH Client, Database, Performance, etc.)
- Easy troubleshooting
- No performance impact (async writing)

**Why it's cool:** When something goes wrong, you can actually debug it!

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

### Async Everything
All heavy operations now run in background:
- Database writes
- File operations
- Log writing
- Statistics calculations

**Result:** Zero lag, no TPS drops!

### Config Caching
Configuration values are cached for 5 minutes:
- Reduces file reads
- Faster config access
- Less disk I/O

**Result:** Snappier plugin response!

### Thread Management
Professional thread pools:
- 4 dedicated worker threads
- Proper cleanup
- No thread leaks

**Result:** Stable, reliable performance!

## 🎨 Visual Enhancements

### Boss Bars
Show work unit progress as a colored bar at top of screen:
- Green bar fills as work completes
- Shows percentage
- Auto-hides when done

### Title Messages
Big celebration when work units complete:
- Title: "Work Unit Complete!"
- Subtitle: "+1,234 points"
- Fades in/out nicely

### Action Bar Updates
Real-time updates above hotbar:
- "Folding@home Progress: 45%"
- "✓ Completed work unit - +1,234 points"
- Non-intrusive, quick info

## 📊 New Commands

```
/fah gui
  → Opens interactive statistics menu

## 🗃️ Database Tables

Your plugin now has a proper database (`plugins/FAHResourceDonor/fahdata.db`):

**player_contributions**: Track each player's stats
**server_statistics**: Hourly server snapshots
**work_unit_history**: Every work unit completed
**rewards_given**: All rewards distributed

Query these for analytics, leaderboards, etc.!

- `fah-2025-10-29.log` (today)
- `fah-2025-10-28.log` (yesterday)
- etc.

Each entry has:
- Timestamp
- Log level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Category (FAHClient, Database, etc.)
- Message
