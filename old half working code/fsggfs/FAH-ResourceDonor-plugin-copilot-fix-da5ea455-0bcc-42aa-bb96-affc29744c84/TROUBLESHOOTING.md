# FAH ResourceDonor Plugin - Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸš¨ Plugin Says "Running" But Not Contributing to Research

This is the most common issue. Here's how to fix it:

### Step 1: Check Your Passkey
Your Folding@Home passkey is crucial for crediting your work.

1. **Get a passkey:** Visit https://apps.foldingathome.org/getpasskey
2. **Copy the ENTIRE passkey** (32+ characters, letters and numbers only)
3. **Add to config.yml:**
   ```yaml
   fah:
     passkey: "YOUR_FULL_PASSKEY_HERE"
   ```
4. **Reload:** `/fah reload` or restart server

### Step 2: Enable Debug Mode
```yaml
debug: true
```

This will show detailed logs in your console explaining what's happening.

### Step 3: Run Diagnostics
Use the command: `/fah diagnose`

This will test:
- âœ“ Token validity
- âœ“ Internet connection
- âœ“ FAH server connectivity
- âœ“ Donor name uniqueness
- âœ“ Team verification

### Step 4: Check Common Issues

#### Issue: "Token not configured"
**Solution:** Add your passkey to config.yml and reload

#### Issue: "Failed to initialize FAH client"
**Solutions:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify firewall allows outbound connections
- Try restarting the plugin

#### Issue: "Not processing work units"
**Solutions:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes for work assignment
- Check if FAH servers are online
- Restart the plugin with `/fah stop` then `/fah start`

#### Issue: "Connection timeout"
**Solutions:**
- Check firewall settings
- Verify your server has internet access
- Try different DNS servers

#### Issue: "Work not appearing in FAH account"
**Solutions:**
- Verify your passkey is correct
- Make sure donor name is unique
- Check https://stats.foldingathome.org/donor/YourDonorName
- It can take 30+ minutes for stats to update
