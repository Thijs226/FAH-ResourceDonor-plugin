# Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

The user requested fixes for several critical issues with the FAH ResourceDonor plugin:

1. ❌ FAH does not auto-start when you restart the server
2. ❌ After restart, you need to manually start it on the folding@home website
3. ❌ Needs better token/account connection
4. ❌ Does not properly adjust CPU cores on single-port servers
5. ⚠️ Needs to use consistent port from server.properties

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Auto-Start After Server Restart

**Changes:**
- Added `loadPersistedState()` method to restore previous FAH state
- Added `persistState()` method to save current state after changes
- Added `scheduleAutoRestart()` for periodic health checks (60s interval)
- Modified `startFAHClient()` to auto-resume with previous core count

**Files Modified:**
- `FAHClientManager.java`: Added persistence and auto-restart logic
- `config.yml`: Added `auto-start` configuration section

**How it Works:**
1. When FAH core count changes, state is saved to `fah-state.properties`
2. On server restart, `loadPersistedState()` restores the previous core count
3. `startFAHClient()` checks if cores > 0 and auto-resumes FAH
4. Periodic health check ensures FAH stays running

### 2. ✅ Auto-Resume Without Manual Intervention

**Changes:**
- Updated FAH config.xml to include `<power v='full'/>`
- Added `<on-idle v='false'/>` and `<idle-seconds v='0'/>`
- Set slot configuration to `<paused v='false'/>`
- Added 10-second delayed auto-unpause after FAH initialization

**Files Modified:**
- `FAHClientManager.java`: Enhanced `updateConfigXml()` methods
- `FAHClientManager.java`: Added auto-unpause in `startFAHClient()`

**How it Works:**
1. FAH config ensures client runs at full power
2. Client never pauses due to idle detection
3. After restart, scheduled task runs unpause command
4. Work continues automatically without manual intervention

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Token/Account Connection

**Changes:**
- Improved `/fah token` command with validation
- Added token length check (warns if < 10 characters)
- Added automatic verification after token setup
- Enhanced feedback with emoji and clear instructions
- Support for multi-word machine names

**Files Modified:**
- `FAHCommands.java`: Enhanced `handleToken()` method
- `FAHClientManager.java`: Improved `reconfigureWithToken()`

**How it Works:**
1. User runs `/fah token <token> My Machine Name`
2. Plugin validates token length
3. Token saved to config and FAH restarted
4. After 5 seconds, verification checks if token applied
5. User receives clear success/failure message

### 4. ✅ Optimized Single-Port Server Support

**Changes:**
- Enhanced logging in `setCoresFileMode()` to clarify behavior
- Added success message when CLI commands work
- Improved failure handling with clear explanations
- Better documentation of when restart is needed

**Files Modified:**
- `FAHClientManager.java`: Enhanced `setCoresFileMode()` logging
- `config.yml`: Documented single-port configuration
- `README.md`: Added single-port optimization guide

**How it Works:**
1. Plugin tries CLI commands first (`slot-modify 0 cpus X`)
2. If CLI succeeds, cores change without restart
3. Logs "Successfully applied X cores via CLI (no restart needed)"
4. Only restarts FAH after 3 consecutive CLI failures
5. Preserves work units whenever possible

### 5. ✅ Port Configuration

**Changes:**
- Default config sets `control-port: 0` for single-port servers
- Auto-detection of available ports for internal communication
- File-based mode as default (`no-port-mode: "file-based"`)
- Port configuration clearly documented

**Files Modified:**
- `config.yml`: Pre-configured for single-port hosting
- `FAHClientManager.java`: Auto-port detection logic
- `README.md`: Port configuration documentation

**How it Works:**
1. Default config disables external ports (control-port: 0)
2. If port needed, auto-detects from server.properties + 1
3. File-based mode works without any ports
4. Perfect for shared hosting with single port

## Technical Details

### State Persistence

**File:** `plugins/FAHResourceDonor/fah-state.properties`

```properties
cores=4
running=true
last-update=1730195400000
```

### Auto-Resume Flow

```
Server Start
    ↓
Load State File
    ↓
cores > 0? → Yes → Start FAH with saved cores
    ↓              ↓
    No          Wait 10s → Auto-unpause
    ↓              ↓
Use default    Work Resumes
```

### File-Based Mode Flow

```
Player joins/leaves
    ↓
Calculate new cores
    ↓
Try CLI command (slot-modify)
    ↓
Success? → Yes → Save config → Update cores
    ↓              (no restart)
    No
    ↓
Failed 3 times? → Yes → Restart FAH
    ↓              (brief interruption)
    No
    ↓
Retry later
```
